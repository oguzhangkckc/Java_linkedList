# Java_linkedList

This project aims to enable the computerized play of a game called "TOMBALA". The project consists of a main screen where users determine the number of players. Users select a number of players between 1 and 4 using buttons on the main screen. After selecting the number of players, the game starts by clicking the "Start Game" button.
Upon starting the game, a screen appears that generates random numbers. These numbers are matched with the numbers on the players' cards. Each player has their own card, and these cards are stored in a multi-linked list structure. Each player's card is represented through nodes stored in the linked list.
